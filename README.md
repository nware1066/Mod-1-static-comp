### Project Overview:

This project was designed without JavaScript in order to focus on HTML and CSS, since up to this point, JavaScript has been the primary focus of our curriculum. We were provided with an image to replicate, with the understanding that we were at liberty to change images and colors, but not the layout of the page.

In addition, we were required to use normalize or reset in the CSS, I chose to use normalize, since I am under the impression that this is more common. The site was also required to be responsive, so I stayed away from fixed sizes and used media queries to alter the layout at different widths.

### Wins:

I used the project as an opportunity to try different methods of achieving my goals and in doing so, I learned a great deal.

This project helped me see very clearly that every element is genuinely a box, and css is about manipulating thos boxes so that they line up (or nest) the way that you want them to.

I was more intentional in my use of semantic HTML, and while I am not an expert, I am beginning to understand semantic HTML and to consider it more when I am writing code. I was also intentional about the order of my CSS selectors, so that they are arranged in an order that follows the order that the elements appear on the page, making it easier to understand the code.

### Challenges:

I had several challenges during this project, mostly because I chose to experiment with different methods than I have used in the past, and also that I chose to try different ways to get the same effect, instead of staying with the first one that worked.

I also had a significan problem with my git workflow, which I still do not entirely uderstand, but which resulted in having two separate projects both combined in the repository. I eventually had to delete the repo and start over. I was able to save the code, but failed to save my images, which cost additional time and stress. Altogether that was the most challenging part of the project, costing me a great deal of time and also losing my commit history for the majority of the project.
